# Resy Roulette

**Resy Roulette** is a (currently WIP) functional app catering to indecisive casual diners and food fanatics alike. The app allows its users to specify certain optional queries for restaurants, for example, the number of guests, location, or cuisine, before returning a random restaurant or restaurants that satisfy the requests.

## Features
**Resy Roulette** is written in Python, with plans of futures migration to Flask for the frontend. The app helps users decide on a restaurant to eat at, with optional queries such as:
- Restaurant location
- Restaurant cuisine(s)
- and Number of guests,

helping to satisfy any requests.

The restaurants are found using calls to the Resy API.

## Quickstart

## Future Plans
- Migrate front end to either website or app using Flask
- Improve graphical user interface
- Documentation
